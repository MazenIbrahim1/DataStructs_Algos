# 4.7 Build Order
# You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of
# projects, where the second project is dependent on the first project). All of a project's dependencies
# must be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If there
# is no valid build order, return an error.
