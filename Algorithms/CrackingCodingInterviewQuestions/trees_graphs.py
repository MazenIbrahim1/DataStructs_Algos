# Questions 4.1 - 4.12

# 4.1 Route between nodes
# Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a
# route between two nodes.
def route(graph, node1, node2):
    pass

# 4.2 Minimal Tree
# Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm
# to create a binary search tree with minimal height.
def minimal_tree(arr):
    pass

# 4.3 List of Depths
# Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes
# at each depth
def list_of_depths(tree):
    pass

# 4.4 Check Balanced
# Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of
# this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any
# node never differ by more than one.
def check_balanced(tree):
    pass

# 4.5 Validate BST
# Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
def validBST(tree):
    pass
